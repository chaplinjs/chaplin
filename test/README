To compile the source and the specs from CoffeeScript to JavaScript,
run these commands in the repository root:

coffee --bare --output test/js/ src/
coffee --bare --output test/js/ test/spec/

This compiles both to the directory test/js/.

Now open test/index.html in a browser to run the tests.

For test-driven development, start both commands with the --watch option
so the code is compiled whenever the library or the test code changes.
