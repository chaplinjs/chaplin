# Getting started

# Download the boilerplate

The easiest way to start a Chaplin application is to download the boilerplate. It contains a recent build of Chaplin as well as all JavaScript libraries Chaplin depends upon:

* [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) as AMD module loader

This is just the standard setup. You may substitute Underscore with [Lodash](http://lodash.com/docs), jQuery with [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) and RequireJS with different other AMD module loaders like [Curl](https://github.com/cujojs/curl).

The boilerplate comes in two flavours:

- [CoffeeScript code](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate), if you develop your application in CoffeeScript
- [Plain JavaScript code](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate-plain), if you develop your application in normal JavaScript

Download the using git:

```
git archive --remote=https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate.git  HEAD
```
