# Chaplin.CollectionView

The `CollectionView` is responsible for displaying collections. For every item in a collection, it instantiates a given item view and inserts it into the DOM. It reacts to collection change events (`add`, `remove` and `reset`) and provides basic filtering, caching of views, fallback content and loading indicators.
