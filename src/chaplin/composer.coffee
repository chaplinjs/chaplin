# Composer
# --------

# The sole job of the composer is to allow views to be 'composed'.
#
# If the view has already been composed by a previous action then nothing
# apart from registering the view as in use happens. Else, the view
# is instantiated and passed the options that were passed in. If an action
# is routed to where a view that was composed is not re-composed, the
# composed view is disposed.

  # Constructs a composition and composes into the active compositions.
  # This function has several forms as described below:
  #
  # 1. compose('name', Class[, options])
  #    Composes a class object. The options are passed to the class when
  #    an instance is contructed and are further used to test if the
  #    composition should be re-composed.
  #
  # 2. compose('name', function)
  #    Composes a function that executes in the context of the controller;
  #    do NOT bind the function context.
  #
  # 3. compose('name', options, function)
  #    Composes a function that executes in the context of the controller;
  #    do NOT bind the function context and is passed the options as a
  #    parameter. The options are further used to test if the composition
  #    should be recomposed.
  #
  # 4. compose('name', options)
  #    Gives control over the composition process; the compose method of
  #    the options hash is executed in place of the function of form (3) and
  #    the check method is called (if present) to determine re-composition (
  #    otherwise this is the same as form [3]).
  #
  # 5. compose('name', CompositionClass[, options])
  #    Gives complete control over the composition process.
