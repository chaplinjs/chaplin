  #### Core Object Instantiation
  # The application instantiates three **core modules**:
  dispatcher: null
  layout: null
  router: null
  composer: null

  initialize: ->

  # **Chaplin.Dispatcher** sits between the router and controllers to listen
  # for routing events. When they occur, Chaplin.Dispatcher loads the target
  # controller module and instantiates it before invoking the target action.
  # Any previously active controller is automatically disposed.

  initDispatcher: (options) ->
    @dispatcher = new Dispatcher options

  # **Chaplin.Layout** is the top-level application view. It *does not
  # inherit* from Chaplin.View but borrows some of its functionalities. It
  # is tied to the document dom element and registers application-wide
  # events, such as internal links. And mainly, when a new controller is
  # activated, Chaplin.Layout is responsible for changing the main view to
  # the view of the new controller.

  initLayout: (options = {}) ->
    options.title ?= @title
    @layout = new Layout options

  initComposer: (options = {}) ->
    @composer = new Composer options

  # **Chaplin.Router** is responsible for observing URL changes. The router
  # is a replacement for Backbone.Router and *does not inherit from it*
  # directly. It's a different implementation with several advantages over
  # the standard router provided by Backbone. The router is typically
  # initialized by passing the function returned by **routes.coffee**.

  initRouter: (routes, options) ->
    # Save the reference for testing introspection only.
    # Modules should communicate with each other via **publish/subscribe**.
    @router = new Router options

    # Register any provided routes.
    routes? @router.match

  #### Disposal
  disposed: false

  dispose: ->
    #Am I already disposed?
    return if @disposed

    properties = ['dispatcher', 'layout', 'router', 'composer']
    for prop in properties when this[prop]?
      this[prop].dispose()
      delete this[prop]

    @disposed = true

    # You're frozen when your heart's not open.
    Object.freeze? this
