# Mediator constructor
# --------------------

# The mediator is a simple object all others modules use to
# communicate with each other. It implements the Publish/Subscribe pattern.
#
# Additionally, it holds two common objects which need to be shared
# between modules: the user and the router.
#
# You might store additional objects on the mediator or
# you might introduce another object(s) as shared data storage
# so this mediator doesnâ€™t get the kitchen sink of your app.
#
# This module return a method which creates a mediator.
# The actual application-specific mediator is created in
# /mediator.coffee using this very function.

# Shortcut flag for proper ES5 property descriptor support
descriptorsSupported = support.propertyDescriptors

# The actual function which creates a mediator object
module.exports = (options = {}) ->

  _(options).defaults

    createUserProperty: true

  # Wrapper for ES5 Object.defineProperty
  defineProperty = (prop, descriptor) ->
    return unless descriptorsSupported
    Object.defineProperty mediator, prop, descriptor

  # Helper method to make properties readonly and not configurable
  readonlyDescriptor =
    writable: false
    enumerable: true
    configurable: false

  readonly = ->
    return unless descriptorsSupported

  # Publish / Subscribe
  # -------------------

  # Mixin event methods from Backbone.Events,
  # create Publish/Subscribe aliases
  mediator.subscribe   = mediator.on      = Backbone.Events.on
  mediator.unsubscribe = mediator.off     = Backbone.Events.off
  mediator.publish     = mediator.trigger = Backbone.Events.trigger

    # In browsers which support ECMAScript 5 property descriptors,
    # the user property is not writable directly.

    # The actual value is saved as a private variable.
