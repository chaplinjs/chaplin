# An Application Architecture Using Backbone.js

## Introduction

Chaplin is an architecture for JavaScript applications using the [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) library.

All information, commercial support contacts and examples are available at [chaplinjs.org](http://chaplinjs.org). [Comprehensive documentation and class reference](docs/) is available on GitHub.

[Download the latest release on chaplinjs.org](http://chaplinjs.org/#downloads). See below on how to compile from source manually.

## Building Chaplin

The Chaplin source files are originally written in the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) meta-language. However, the Chaplin library file is a compiled JavaScript file which defines the `chaplin` module.

Our build script compiles the CoffeeScripts and bundles them into one file. To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps.
3. Install the Node package for the grunt command line interface globally.

   ```sh
   sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
   ```

   On Windows, you can omit the `sudo` command at the beginning.

4. Change into the Chaplin root directory.
5. Start the build (will install dependencies and build).

   ```
   npm install
   ```

This creates two directories:

* `./build/amd/` with a build using the AMD module style
* `./build/commonjs/` with a build using the CommonJS module style

These directories contain four files each:

* `chaplin.js` – The library as a compiled JavaScript file.
* `chaplin.min.js` – Minified. For production use you should pick this.
* `chaplin.min.js.gz` – Minified and GZip-compressed.

## Running the Tests

Chaplin aims to be fully unit-tested. At the moment most of the modules are covered by Mocha tests.

How to run the tests:

1. Follow the steps for [building chaplin](#building-chaplin).
2. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps.
3. Change into the Chaplin root directory.
4. Start the test runner.

   ```
   npm test
   ```

Note that you can now additionally open `test/index.html` to run the tests in your browser (instead of in node).
Furthermore code coverage reports are generated and may be viewed by opening `test/coverage/index.html` in your browser.
