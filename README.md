# An Application Architecture Using Backbone.js

## Introduction

Chaplin is an architecture for JavaScript applications using the [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) library. The code is derived from [moviepilot.com](http://moviepilot.com/), a large single-page application.

## Upcoming Version 1.0: Chaplin as a Library

While the initial release of Chaplin was merely an example application structure, Chaplin is being rewritten into a reusable and fully unit-tested library. The `master` branch already reflects these changes. We’re almost done, the code is already stable and successfully used in production. We don’t expect breaking API changes until version 1.0. There are only a few things to polish up before the 1.0 release:

* [A comprehensive documentation and class reference](http://chaplinjs.github.com/)
* Easier configurability of the default behavior
* Flexibility, like use in non-CoffeeScript and non-AMD environments

## Key Features

* CoffeeScript class hierarchies as well as object composition
* Module encapsulation and lazy-loading using AMD modules
* Cross-module communication using the Mediator and Publish/Subscribe patterns
* Controllers for managing individual UI views
* Rails-style routes which map URLs to controller actions
* A route dispatcher and a top-level view manager
* Extended model, view and collection classes to avoid repetition and enforce conventions
* Strict memory management and object disposal
* A collection view for easy and intelligent list rendering

## Motivation

![Modern Times](http://s3.amazonaws.com/imgly_production/3359809/original.jpg)

While developing several web applications using Backbone.js, we felt the need for conventions on how to structure such applications. While Backbone is fine at what it’s doing, it’s not a [framework](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library) for single-page applications. Yet it’s often used for this purpose.

Chaplin is mostly derived and generalized from the codebase of [moviepilot.com](http://moviepilot.com/), a real-world single-page application. Chaplin tries to draw the attention to top-level application architecture. “Application” means everything above simple routing, individual models, views and their binding.

Backbone is an easy starting point, but provides only basic, low-level patterns. Especially, Backbone provides little to structure an actual application. For example, the famous “Todo list example” is not an application in the strict sense nor does it teach best practices how to structure Backbone code.

To be fair, Backbone doesn’t intend to be an all-round framework so it wouldn’t be appropriate to blame Backbone for this deliberate limitations. Nonetheless, most Backbone use cases clearly need a sophisticated application architecture. This is where Chaplin enters the stage.

## Dependencies

Chaplin depends on the following libraries:

* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (> 0.9.2)
* [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (> 1.4.2) or [lodash](http://lodash.com/) (> 0.8.2)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (> 1.8.2) or [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com) (> 1.0rc1)

If you’ll be using AMD version, you will also need an AMD module loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) or [curl](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) to load Chaplin and lazy-module application modules

## Building Chaplin

The individual source files of Chaplin are originally written in the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) meta-language. However, the Chaplin library file is a compiled JavaScript file which defines a single `chaplin` module.

There’s a build script which compiles the CoffeeScripts and bundles them into one file. To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the Node packages for CoffeeScript and UglifierJS globally. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and run these commands:

   ```
   sudo npm install -g coffee-script
   sudo npm install -g uglify-js
   ```

   This assumes you’re working on a Unix machine (Linux, Mac OS, BSD…). On Windows, you can omit the `sudo` command at the beginning.

3. Install the Node package ShellJS normally. On the shell, run this command:

   ```
   npm install shelljs
   ```

4. On the shell, start the build by typing:

   ```
   cake build
   ```

This creates two directories:

* `./build/amd/` with a build using the AMD module style
* `./build/commonjs/` with a build using the CommonJS module style

These directories contain four files each:

* `chaplin-VERSION.coffee` – The Chaplin library as a CoffeeScript file.
* `chaplin-VERSION.js` – The library as a compiled JavaScript file.
* `chaplin-VERSION-min.js` – Minified. For production use you should pick this.
* `chaplin-VERSION-min.js.gz` – Minified and GZip-compressed.

## Running the Tests

Chaplin aims to be fully unit-tested. At the moment most of the modules are covered by Mocha tests.

To run the tests, the source files and the specs need to be compiled using the CoffeeScript compiler first. Run `cake test` in the repository’s root directory, then open the test runner (`test/index.html`) in a browser.

## Boilerplate
[Chaplin Boilerplate](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate) is a base application project for Chaplin. You can use it freely as a skeleton for your chaplin project.

If you’re not a CoffeeScript user, there’s also a plain JavaScript boilerplate: [Chaplin Boilerplate-Plain](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate-plain)

### Brunch with Chaplin
[github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin](https://github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin)

Brunch with Chaplin is a skeleton application, where [brunch](http://brunch.io) is used for assembling files & assets. It has ready-to-use classes for session management, html5boilerplate and stylus / handlebars.js as app languages.

## Examples

Several example applications are available today:

### Facebook Like Browser
[github.com/chaplinjs/facebook-example](https://github.com/chaplinjs/facebook-example)

This example uses Facebook client-side authentication to display the user’s Likes.

### Ost.io
[github.com/paulmillr/ostio](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio) is a forum for GitHub projects and a modern replacement for mailing lists.

Ost.io serves as a good example of a fast service-based application, using *Ruby on Rails* as a lightweight backend [(which is open-sourced too)](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio-api/) that only handles authentication / server-side logic & talks JSON to clients. In this way, frontend is completely decoupled from the backend which gives the ability to work on both projects in parallel and increases scalability, speed & mainbtability quite a lot.

### Tweet your Brunch
[github.com/brunch/twitter](https://github.com/brunch/twitter) is a simple twitter client. It uses Twitter client-side authentication to display user’s feed and to create new tweets.
