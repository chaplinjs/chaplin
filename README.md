## Key Features

* CoffeeScript class hierarchies as well as object composition
* Module encapsulation and lazy-loading using AMD modules
* Cross-module communication using the Mediator and Publish/Subscribe patterns
* Introducing Controllers that represent UI screens
* Rails-style declarative routes that map URLs to controller actions
* A route dispatcher and a top-level view manager
* Extended model, view and collection classes to avoid repetition and enforce conventions
* Strict memory management and object disposal
* A collection view for easy and intelligent list rendering

## Motivation

![Modern Times](http://s3.amazonaws.com/imgly_production/3359809/original.jpg)

While developing several web applications using Backbone.js, we felt the need for conventions on how to structure such applications. Backbone is an easy starting point, but provides only basic, low-level patterns. Especially, Backbone provides little to structure an actual application. For example, the famous “[Todo list](http://todomvc.com/)” is not an application in the strict sense nor does it teach best practices how to structure Backbone code.

Backbone doesn’t intend to be an all-round [framework](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library) so it’s not appropriate to blame Backbone for these deliberate limitations. Nonetheless, most Backbone use cases need a sophisticated application architecture.

This is where Chaplin enters the stage. Chaplin is derived from the codebase of [moviepilot.com](http://moviepilot.com/), a real-world single-page application. It draws attention to the top-level architecture: everything above simple routing, individual models, views and their binding.

## Dependencies

Chaplin depends on the following libraries:

* [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (> 0.9.2)
* [Underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/) (> 1.4.2) or [lodash](http://lodash.com/) (> 0.8.2)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (> 1.8.2) or [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com) (> 1.0rc1)

If you’ll be using AMD version, you will also need an AMD module loader like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond) or [curl](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) to load Chaplin and lazy-module application modules

## Download Chaplin

### Using bower
1. Install the Node package for the Bower package manager.

   ```sh
   sudo npm install -g bower
   ```

2. Install chaplin via bower.

   ```sh
   bower install chaplin
   ```

   Specific versions may be requested as follows:

   ```sh
   bower install chaplin#0.6.0
   ```

   This will also download the required version of backbone but will _not_
   download the required DOM manipulation or utility libraries. These can be
   installed separately via `bower install underscore`, `bower install jquery`,
   `bower install lodash`, etc.

### Manually
[Download the latest release on chaplinjs.org](http://chaplinjs.org/#downloads). See below on how to compile from source manually.

## Building Chaplin

The Chaplin source files are originally written in the [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) meta-language. However, the Chaplin library file is a compiled JavaScript file which defines the `chaplin` module.

Our build script compiles the CoffeeScripts and bundles them into one file. To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps.
3. Install the Node package for the grunt command line interface globally.

   ```sh
   sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
   ```

   On Windows, you can omit the `sudo` command at the beginning.

4. Change into the Chaplin root directory.
5. Start the build.

   ```
   npm install
   ```

This creates two directories:

* `./build/amd/` with a build using the AMD module style
* `./build/commonjs/` with a build using the CommonJS module style

These directories contain four files each:

* `chaplin.js` – The library as a compiled JavaScript file.
* `chaplin.min.js` – Minified. For production use you should pick this.
* `chaplin.min.js.gz` – Minified and GZip-compressed.

## Running the Tests

Chaplin aims to be fully unit-tested. At the moment most of the modules are covered by Mocha tests.

How to run the tests:

1. Follow the steps for [building chaplin](#building-chaplin).
2. Open a shell (aka terminal aka command prompt) and type in the commands in the following steps.
3. Change into the Chaplin root directory.
4. Start the test runner.

   ```
   npm test
   ```

Note that you can now additionally open `test/index.html` to run the tests in your browser (instead of in node).
Furthermore code coverage reports are generated and may be viewed by opening `test/coverage/index.html` in your browser.

## Boilerplates

Chaplin needs a simple skeleton to start up and configure the core modules. We provides several boilerplates to make the start easier.

[Chaplin Boilerplate](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate) is a “Hello world” example project using Chaplin. If you’re not a CoffeeScript user, there’s also a [plain JavaScript boilerplate](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate-plain).

For Ruby on Rails users, we’ve compiled a [Boilerplate Rails Application with Backbone, Chaplin and Require.js](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-rails).

### Brunch with Chaplin

[github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin](https://github.com/paulmillr/brunch-with-chaplin)

Brunch with Chaplin is a skeleton application, where [brunch](http://brunch.io) is used for assembling files & assets. It has ready-to-use classes for session management, html5boilerplate and stylus / handlebars.js as app languages.

## Examples

Several example applications are available today:

### Facebook Like Browser

[github.com/chaplinjs/facebook-example](https://github.com/chaplinjs/facebook-example)

This example uses Facebook client-side authentication to display the user’s Likes.

### Ost.io

[github.com/paulmillr/ostio](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio) is a forum for GitHub projects and a modern replacement for mailing lists.

Ost.io serves as a good example of a fast service-based application, using *Ruby on Rails* as a lightweight backend [(which is open-sourced too)](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio-api/) that only handles authentication / server-side logic & talks JSON to clients. In this way, frontend is completely decoupled from the backend which gives the ability to work on both projects in parallel and increases scalability, speed & mainbtability quite a lot.

### Tweet your Brunch

[github.com/brunch/twitter](https://github.com/brunch/twitter) is a simple twitter client. It uses Twitter client-side authentication to display user’s feed and to create new tweets.
